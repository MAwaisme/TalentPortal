### Testing

All tests are colocated with the source code inside the same directory. So, it makes it easier to find them. Unfortunately, it is not possible with the `pages` folder which is used by Next.js for routing. So, what is why we have a `pages.test` folder to write tests from files located in `pages` folder.
